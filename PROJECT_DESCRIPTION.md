## Architecture & Security

The application follows a modern three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns. The frontend React application communicates with the Express.js backend through RESTful APIs, while MongoDB serves as the persistent data layer. Security measures include password hashing with bcrypt, JWT-based authentication, and secure file upload handling. The application implements proper error handling, input validation, and CORS configuration for cross-origin requests.

## Impact & Results

Created a user-friendly platform that streamlines the job search and recruitment process. The application successfully handles user authentication, job management, and application processing while maintaining data security and providing an excellent user experience. The responsive design ensures accessibility across various devices, making it convenient for users to access the platform anytime, anywhere.
